BXtoolbox package

A LaTeX package to provide part of the functions of etoolbox for non-e-TeX engines, plus more.

1. Overview

The main goal of this package is to provide part of the functions of
the etoolbox package for TeX engines without e-TeX extension. Today
this idea sounds rather anachronic, since seemingly all of the TeX
engines that run the LaTeX system and one who develops LaTeX packages
no longer needs to care about such antique of non-e-TeX engines. The
surprising fact is, however, this is not true, at least in the small
region of the world. The reason is the existence of pTeX, a TeX engine
localized for the Japanese langauge. It is only few years ago that
e-TeX extended pTeX (natually named e-pTeX) came into being. And now
in Japan many people still use pTeX without e-TeX extension (and some
of them don't have e-pTeX on their machines).
(... to be continued)

Note that when this package is loaded in e-TeX engines, then it loads
the real etoolbox and uses the functions of that package.

4. "Fakes" provided by this package

  These commands have a name of that of the original prefixed by "bx".
  Some come in two version: \bxZzz works as \zzz but is lack of
  expandability \zzz has, whereas \bxZzzX is expandable as \zzz is but
  otherwise flawed.

  - \bxNewrobustcmd: uses LaTeX-protect instead of \protected
  - \bxRenewrobustcmd: ditto
  - \bxProviderobustcmd: ditto
  - \bxRobustify: ditto
  - \bxCsuse: forbidden in moving arguments
  - \bxCsuseX: suffering from \relax'ifying
  - \bxCsshow: forbidden in moving arguments
  - \bxIfcsdef: forbidden in moving arguments
  - \bxIfcsundef: forbidden in moving arguments
  - \bxIfcsundefX: suffering from \relax'ifying

Note: on e-TeX engines, these commands are simply aliases to the real
commands of etoolbox.
